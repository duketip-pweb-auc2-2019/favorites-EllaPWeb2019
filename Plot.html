                    The first season of the series depicts the first few years of the reign of Queen Victoria (portrayed by Jenna Coleman), from her accession to the throne at the age of eighteen, 
                    to her intense friendship and infatuation with Lord Melbourne (Rufus Sewell), to her courtship and early marriage to Prince Albert (Tom Hughes) and finally to the birth of their first child, Victoria.
                    The second season follows Victoria's struggles to balance her role as Queen with her duties to her husband and children, various dramas within the English and German branches of the royal family,
                    international relations with France, and such crises as the Anglo-Afghan War and the 1840s Famine in Ireland. At the beginning of the third season, 
                    Victoria and Albert have six children and are approaching their 30s while navigating difficulties in their marriage; as the season progresses, these tensions ebb and flow. 
                    Subplots in the third season include Albert's ongoing efforts to find his place, culminating in The Great Exhibition of 1851, and his efforts to mould his eldest son,
                    the future Edward VII, into a king; Victoria's political relationship with the charismatic Lord Palmerston; the sudden arrival of Victoria's estranged sister, Feodora,
                    at the palace; and a forbidden romance between one of the Queen's ladies and a footman.
