        Victoria is a British period drama television series on ITV starring Jenna Coleman as Britain's second longest monarch Alexandrina Victoria. 
        The early life of Queen Victoria, from her accession to the throne at the tender age of 18 through to her courtship and marriage to Prince Albert.
        Famous for her candor and spirit, she was the first woman who seemed to have it all: a passionate marriage, nine children, and the job of being Queen of the world's most important nation. 
        Victoria's often tumultuous reign lasted for 63 years; she was England's longest-serving monarch until she was overtaken by Elizabeth II in September, 2015. But was her life really that glorious?
