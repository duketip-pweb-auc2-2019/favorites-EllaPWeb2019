                    Victoria is a British historical television drama series created and principally written by Daisy Goodwin, starring Jenna Coleman as Queen Victoria. 
                    The series premiered in the United Kingdom on ITV on 28 August 2016 with eight episodes, and in the United States on PBS on 15 January 2017; PBS supported its production as part of the Masterpiece anthology. 
                    A second series was broadcast on ITV in the fall of 2017, including a Christmas special that aired that December; PBS broadcast followed starting in January 2018, with the special belatedly airing in March.
                    In December 2017, Victoria was renewed for an eight-episode third series, which premiered on PBS on 13 January 2019, and on ITV on 24 March 2019.

                    The series was announced in September 2015, following Coleman's decision to leave Doctor Who to join the cast as Queen Victoria.
                    Daisy Goodwin said in October 2016 that a Christmas special episode for the 2016 series had been proposed and was rejected by ITV; 
                    one was subsequently commissioned for 2017 after the rising ratings popularity for Victoria.
                    In September 2016, ITV renewed Victoria for a second series, followed by a Christmas special. In December 2017, 
                    Victoria was renewed for a third series, with Coleman and Hughes set to return.
                    Beyond the renewal, ITV administration reportedly expects Victoria to run for a total of six series, 
                    although whether Jenna Coleman will remain as the lead actress as the series moves into depicting Victoria's later years is uncertain.
                    Producers Mammoth Screen picked Screen Yorkshire's Church Fenton Studios which is in Tadcaster North Yorkshire, 
                    as the central base for the recreation of Buckingham Palace. Church Fenton Studios recently launched, so Victoria subsequently became the first production to film there. 
                    It is the first time Yorkshire has needed a large scale studio space to host a major drama. Mammoth Screen spent seven months filming the first series in Yorkshire

                    Much of Victoria is filmed in Yorkshire. The interiors of Castle Howard double as Kensington Palace, Harewood House stands in for Buckingham Palace, 
                    with Bramham Park and Wentworth Woodhouse also being in use for both royal residences. Carlton Towers is in use as Windsor Castle, while Beverley Minster replaces Westminster Abbey. 
                    Other locations include Raby Castle, Allerton Castle, Newby Hall and Whitby pier. Church Fenton Studios, a converted aircraft hangar at Leeds East Airport near Selby, 
                    was in use to recreate some interiors of Buckingham Palace. Parts of Liverpool's Georgian quarter were used for exterior locations for the filming of the third series.
